# CEF
A project to explore closed-end fund (CEF) investing.

# Main Questions
1. Are there arbitrage opportunities between CEFs (buy at relative discount, sell at relative premium) or between CEFs and OEFs?
2. Does it ever make sense to switch into a CEF from and OEF and when there are discounts to the CEF.  

# Thoughts
For question 2, the initial exploration shold focus on bond funds. As a substitute vehicle, stock funds will be more problematic from a capital gains perspective for taxable investors.   Bonds are less volatile than stocks and produce more income.  This makes them less likely to have significant capital gains.

With respect to shorting, one must consider the impact of the borrowing cost.
