### Questions
Premium/Discounts (PD): Since the foundation of this research depends upon the ability to identify PD that will shrink, we need to examine the distribution of PD.  Do premiums/discounts mean revert?   How fast?  Are they independent or do they move together as a group?  If they move together as a group, does the PD of a single CEF out of synch tend to shrink more quickly.  Also, I'd like to avoid look ahead bias when figuring out reversion.

Borrowing Costs:  Is there a relationship between the borrowing cost and the PD?
